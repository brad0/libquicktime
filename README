------------------------------------------------------------------------

libquicktime is a library for reading and writing quicktime files. It
is based on the quicktime4linux library, with the following
extensions:

    * Sourcetree upgraded with autoconf/automake/libtool and all the 
other stuff, people like in "standard" linux libraries.
    * All 3rd party libraries (jpeg, OggVorbis) were removed to reduce 
download size, compilation time and code duplication on users harddisks. 
Instead, the sytemwide installed libaries are autodetected by the 
configure script.
    * All codecs have been moved into dynamically loadable modules. 
This makes it possible to distribute closed source codecs (or codecs 
with an incompatible license) as separate packages.
    * Unlike other quicktime libraries, we are source compatible with 
quicktime4linux. Programs like cinelerra or xmovie can be compiled with 
libquicktime (if the build system is modified, see our web page for more 
info).
    * The codecs themselves are also source compatible with 
quicktime4linux, so porting codecs between quicktime4linux and 
libquicktime requires only little brain load.
    * Special API extensions allow access to the codec registry. 
Applications can get important information about the codecs, their 
settable parameters etc. at runtime.

For build and installation instructions see INSTALL.
