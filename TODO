Before Prerelease:

- Clarify, if our BC_YUV420P is YV12 or I420 and adapt all plugins for this
  (Or introduce 2 colormodels?)

- Due to the increased number of header files, we should think, if
  we want to install our headers in <prefix>/include/libquicktime

Before "real" (stable or whatever) Release:

- Check, if we want another codec fuction get_best_colormodel() and
  export this to a public quicktime_get_best_colormodel(). This would
  be possible for most codecs and enable optimized video handling in
  applications.

- Discuss, which types codec for parameters we want to support (so we can
  freeze the codec API). Currently, we have int and string, but only int is
  used for now. Avifile has stringlist as an additional type (string
  with several options) defined. It could be used for menus like:

  Motion Compensation  Zero
                       Logarithmic
                       Fastest

  Also bool could be an own type, but it can also be identified by using integer and
  setting the minimum value to 0 and the maximum value to 1.

Before binary release (prepare for having codecs as separate packages from different
people):

- Write a libquicktime-config script. This should have an option --plugin-dir, so it can
  be used by install scripts of binary only plugins.

- Write a libquicktime.m4 file with a macro AM_PATH_LIBQUICKTIME(). (will be installed in
  /usr/share/aclocal) Everyone hijacks this from gtk :-). The macro should also define the
  plugin directory, so it can be used for "make install" of 3rd party plugins. Here, we
  could eventually pass the minimum library version (or a codec API version?).

Library:

- Support reading compressed headers (look at openquicktime, simple zlib decompression).

- Research, how we can overload the reading and writing functions. With this, we can write
  modules for files, http, rtsp, ftp, output to a streaming server etc.


- Write a small C program, which is installed in the $PATH and updates the plugin registry.
  This can also be called by install scripts and makefiles.
  Maybe some console output, which new codecs were found.
  The same will however, always be done by all libquicktime applications.

Codecs:

- Try the rtjpeg codec in the libquicktime source (it's documented nowhere and was not
  activated in quicktime4linux).

- Implement encoding parameters for the png codec.

- Meditate about an mng codec (there exists an opensource one for windows)

- Check, if we can support the binary only divx4linux codec without loosing
  compatibility (or make a new fourcc for divx4linux?)
  This would bring some more features and maybe more speed.

- Make postprocessing a parameter for the current divx decoder

- Find valid min and max values for all codec parameters (especially divx)

- Wait for xvid (www.videocoding.de) and try this

- Port quicktime codecs from the opensource part of xanim (are are lot, mostly old and
  simple ones) to libquicktime (Does the xanim license allow this?)

- Copy the twos codec and make a "swot" quicktime codec from this (by just changing
  endianess)

- Write an mp3 decoder (with the faster mpg123 or higher quality mad?)

- Check, if we want to have a libuicktime plugin which dlopens the 3ivx codec

- Check for the vp3 codec (www.vp3.com). It's opensource but commercial and available as
  quicktime codec on Win32 and Mac AFAIK.

- Check for a loader of dynamic xanim DLLs (for some commercial closed source codecs).
  According to the codec licenses however, it's not allowed to use binary xanim codecs
  for something other than xanim.

- Meditate about loading win32 DLLs to make even cooler things happen.
