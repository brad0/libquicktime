Before "real" (stable or whatever) Release:

- Check, if we want another codec fuction get_best_colormodel() and
  export this to a public lqt_get_best_colormodel(). This would
  be possible for most codecs and enable optimized video handling in
  applications.

Library:

- Support reading compressed headers (look at openquicktime, simple zlib decompression).

- Research, how we can overload the reading and writing functions. With this, we can write
  modules for files, http, rtsp, ftp, output to a streaming server etc.

- Write a small C program, which is installed in the $PATH and updates the plugin registry.
  This can also be called by install scripts and makefiles.
  Maybe some console output, which new codecs were found.
  The same will however, always be done by all libquicktime applications.

Codecs:

- Try the rtjpeg codec in the libquicktime source (it's documented nowhere and was not
  activated in quicktime4linux).

- Implement encoding parameters for the png codec.

- Meditate about an mng codec (there exists an opensource one for windows)

- Check, if we can support the binary only divx4linux codec without loosing
  compatibility (or make a new fourcc for divx4linux?)
  This would bring some more features and maybe more speed.

- Make postprocessing a parameter for the current divx decoder

- Find valid min and max values for all codec parameters (especially divx)

- Wait for xvid (www.videocoding.de) and try this

- Copy the twos codec and make a "swot" quicktime codec from this (by just changing
  endianess)

- Write an mp3 decoder (with the faster mpg123 or higher quality mad?)

- Check, if we want to have a libuicktime plugin which dlopens the 3ivx codec

- Check for the vp3 codec (www.vp3.com). It's opensource but commercial and available as
  quicktime codec on Win32 and Mac AFAIK.

- Write a small LGPL library which contains all xanim codecs and the xanim dll loader
  (Have the permission from xanim author). Write libquicktime plugins for this

- Meditate about loading win32 DLLs to make even cooler things happen.
