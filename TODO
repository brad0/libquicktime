- Try xvid (www.videocoding.de)

- Find replacement for opendivx encoder (i.e.
  some MPEG-4 based encoder whose output can be read
  by Quicktime4linux)

- Support Vorbis encoding compatible with
  qtcomponents.sf.net (Fourcc OggV, codec initialization data
  in the stsd atom instead of the first audio chunk)

- Support reading/writing of MPEG-4 esds atoms

- Support AAC audio en-/decoding via faad

- Set compatibility flags for all encoders

- Make MPEG-4 video encoding readable by Apple Quicktime
  (requires at least esds atoms see above).

- Maybe more steps towards proper mp4 encoding?
