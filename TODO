Before public release:

- Make the "scan for codecs" button functional in libquicktime_config

- Check if we want to add patches for xmovie/cinelerra/bcast for lqt support
  (or would this be politically incorrect?)

Library:

- Support reading compressed headers (look at openquicktime, simple
  zlib decompression).

- Research, how we can overload the reading and writing functions.
  With this, we can write modules for files, http, rtsp, ftp, output to a
  streaming server etc.

Codecs:

- Meditate about an mng codec (there exists an opensource one for windows)

- Check, if we can support the binary only divx4linux codec without loosing
  compatibility (or make a new fourcc for divx4linux?)
  This would bring some more features and maybe more speed.

- Try xvid (www.videocoding.de)

- Check, if we want to have a libuicktime plugin which dlopens the 3ivx codec

- Meditate about loading win32 DLLs to make even cooler things happen.

- Enable the ffmpeg svq3 codec
