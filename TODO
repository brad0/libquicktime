Before public release:

- Add advanced lqt_decode_audio functions, which decode all channels at once

- Add functions for getting the best decoding colormodel

- Make the "scan for codecs" button functional in libquicktime_config

- Add support for reordering codecs, so we can have multiple codecs for one fourcc
  (Must be done in libquicktime as well as in libquicktime_config)

- Check if we want to add patches for xmovie/cinelerra/bcast for lqt support
  (or would this be politically incorrect?)

Library:

- Support reading compressed headers (look at openquicktime, simple zlib decompression).

- Research, how we can overload the reading and writing functions. With this, we can write
  modules for files, http, rtsp, ftp, output to a streaming server etc.

Codecs:

- Try the rtjpeg codec in the libquicktime source (it's documented nowhere and was not
  activated in quicktime4linux).

- Meditate about an mng codec (there exists an opensource one for windows)

- Check, if we can support the binary only divx4linux codec without loosing
  compatibility (or make a new fourcc for divx4linux?)
  This would bring some more features and maybe more speed.

- Find valid min and max values for all codec parameters (especially divx)

- Wait for xvid (www.videocoding.de) and try this

- Copy the twos codec and make a "swot" quicktime codec from this (by just changing
  endianess)

- Write an mp3 decoder (with the faster mpg123 or higher quality mad?)

- Check, if we want to have a libuicktime plugin which dlopens the 3ivx codec

- Check for the vp3 codec (www.vp3.com). It's opensource but commercial and available as
  quicktime codec on Win32 and Mac AFAIK.

- Write a small LGPL library which contains all xanim codecs and the xanim dll loader
  (Have the permission from xanim author). Write libquicktime plugins for this

- Meditate about loading win32 DLLs to make even cooler things happen.
